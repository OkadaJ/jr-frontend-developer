Your tasks:

1. The number of liked memes should be displayed on the "Liked memes" button - for example: "Liked memes (2)"
2. The liked memes list should be ordered so that the most recently liked memes are at the top, the oldest ones at the bottom of the page.
3. Liked memes should be persisted on the client and restored when the page is reloaded.
4. Add a router to the project. The "New memes" page should be linked to "/new", the "Liked memes" page to "/liked". If the user tries to access any other route he should be redirected to "/new".

Start with tasks 1 and 2 (order up to you), then continue with 3 and 4 (order again up to you). Spend no more than 2-3 hours of your time. If you can't complete all tasks - no problem!

When you're done, open a pull request in this repository. We will review it and come back to you.

Good luck! :-)
