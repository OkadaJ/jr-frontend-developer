Your tasks:

- Add a router to the project. The "New memes" page should be connected to "/new", the "Liked memes" page to "/liked". If the user tries to access any other route he should be redirected to "/new".
- Liked memes should be persisted on the client and restored when the page is reloaded.

Spend no more than 2 hours of your time. If you can't complete all tasks - no problem.

Good luck! :-)
